How to import the project in eclipse
===========================

This guide assumes that you have installed the Android SDK and the ADT plugin 
for eclipse. If not please see this page (https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html?hl=i).


Install the necessary software
==============================

First you need to add Gradle to your eclipse IDE (https://github.com/spring-projects/eclipse-integration-gradle/):
   1) - install Groovy Eclipse from this update site: 
        http://dist.codehaus.org/groovy/distributions/greclipse/snapshot/e4.2/
      - install everything on the update site except 'm2e Configurator ...'

   2) - install Eclipse Integration Gradle tooling from this update site:
        http://dist.springsource.com/snapshot/TOOLS/gradle/nightly

To get the code you can use egit in your eclipse:
   1) - install egit from this update site:
        http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates

Getting the code
==============================
The code is stored on github. You can either use the git command line to
get the code or use the egit eclipse plugin:
   1) Select "File/Import"
   2) Choose the option "Projects from Git" under the Git folder
   3) Click on "Next"
   4) Select Clone URI
   5) Enter the URI in the URI field: https://github.com/aislab-hevs/magpie.git
   6) Click on "Next"
   7) Select the "master" branch
   8) Click on "Next"
   9) Select "Use the New Project wizard"
  10) Click on Finish

Create a Gradle build
==============================
To run the tests an Emulator or a Device must be connected. If a Device is connected
you can run the tests:
   1) Right click on the Project 
   2) Select "Run As" -> Gradle Build
   3) In the tab "Gradle Tasks" add the following:
      clean build connectedCheck
   4) Click on Run


Add dependencies to the Eclipse Project
==============================
   1) Right click on the Project
   2) Select "Properties"
   3) Select "Java Build Path"
   4) In the tab "Source" add the following folders:
      "src" / "res" / "gen"
   5) Check if you see the libraries "retrofit-1.6.1.jar" and "tupolog-2.1.1.jar"
      under "Android Private Libraries"
   6) If you don't see the libraries add them by clicking on "Add JARS..."
   7) Select the "libs" folder under the MAGPIE project
   8) Click on "Ok"

Rerun the project.
